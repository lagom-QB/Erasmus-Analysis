# What is special about the Erasmus Programme ?

Did you ever wonder about where people in the erasmus programme come from? how about where they are going to? Or what is the duration of the programme?
If you didn't, I did.
Fortunately, I was able to get my hands on data about the programme and went ahead to dig into it.
The data I'm using is pulled from [Erasmus link 2016-2020.](https://data.europa.eu/en)

I was focusing on answering these questions:  
1. Where are people travelling to?  
2. Where are they travelling from?  
3. What is the overall gender of people traveling?   
4. What cities do they travel to? Or from?  
5. At what level of education are they?  
6. What is the nationality of the people travelling?  
7. What is the gender of the traveller?

## Data Cleaning
I filtered the data to get the sectors I was interested in the:

* Participant data 
* Sending organization 
* Recieving organization.  

_Columns_

* Field of education  
* Participant nationality  
* Education level  
* Participant gender  
* Sending country code  
* Sending city  
* Recieving country code  
* Recieving city

## Data Analysis
Focus question was:    
_Where are people traveling from_ and consequently, _where are they travelling to_
